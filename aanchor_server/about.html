<p>
<font size=2 >Atomic accuracy models of protein structures are an invaluable tool for the elucidation of protein function.
  The recent "resolution revolution"  in cryo electron microscopy (cryoEM) has led to an ever increasing number of near atomic resolution density maps deposited in the EM databank EMDB.
  <p>
<font size=2 >Background : </p>
<p>
<font size=2 >The recent cryo-EM resolution revolution enables  de-novo modeling of protein structures into cryo-EM density maps.
Here we present a machine learning based method for the detection of
high confidence anchor amino acid residues in such a map. Such anchor residues
can be exploited in several local de-novo modeling tasks, such as the reliable positioning of secondary
structures, loop modeling

<p>
In PepMatch web-server the user can upload one PDB file of the terget protein(receptor).
<!--In addition, we provide an option for automatic redirection of solutions from <a
href="http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/PatchDock/"> PatchDock </a>
webserver. -->
The output is a ranked list of all the suggented inhibitory peptides of the target protein.

<strong><font size=4 >The Algorithm: </strong> </font><p>
PepMatch efficiently scans a library of protein-protein interfaces, and structurally aligns the target protein surface to the interface regions of both PPI partners. The interface database used is PIFACE (Cukuroglu et al., 2014), which was developed for template based protein-protein docking. The target protein alignment is done along the lines of the SnapDock (Estrin and Wolfson, 2017) Geometric Hashing scheme (Lamdan and Wolfson, 1988) based algorithm. If a good match is detected for one of the partners, a maximal length peptide (typically, 5-12 a.a. length) is extracted from the "opposite" partner across the interface. The extracted candidate peptides are flexibly re-docked and only those resulting in low energy and a highly favorable "docking funnel" are retained. The results are returned in a binding location based clusters, sorted by size.

<font size=2 >Usage:  </p>
<font size=2 >Input:
Receptor: 3D structure of the target protein in a pdb file format. No knowledge of the binding site is required.
Email: email address for results.</p>
<font size=2 >Output: A list of candidate binding peptides, clustered by binding location.</p>
