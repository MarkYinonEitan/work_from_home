	<strong><font size=4  > About </font></strong>
<p>
<font size=2 >AAnchor is a Machine Learning tool for detecting amino acid within 3D image of single particle cryo Electron Microspopy recostruction of a protein molecule.
  <p>
<font size=2 >Atomic accuracy models of protein structures are an invaluable tool for the elucidation of protein function.
  The recent "resolution revolution"  in cryo electron microscopy (cryoEM) has led to an ever increasing number of near atomic resolution density maps deposited in the EM databank EMDB.
  For resoltions of 3 Angstrems and better image quality enables direct detection of amino acids types from 3D cryo EM map.
  AAnchor is a tool for prior detection of reliable  amino acid anchors in the density map, namely obtaineng a list of amino acids  identities and locations. Whilst (sometimes)  the list may contain only a  relatively small number of amino acids, those are established with high confidence.
  <p>


<p>
In AAnchor web-server the user can upload a .map or .mrc file of single particle cryo EM map (such as those obtained from EMDB ,http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/emdb/, database) and specify the map resolution.
The output is a  list of all centers of gravity of detected amino acids.
The output is provided in a form of PDB file, such that it can be easely viewed by existing tools for biomolecule visualization, the location of CG is marker by K atom.
<p>

<strong><font size=4 >The Algorithm: </strong> </font><p>
The heart of the algorithm is Convolution Neural Network which labels a small patch of a cryo EM map according to an amino acid type it contains.
The input map is searched used sliding window and amino acids detected with low confidence are filtered out.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<strong><font size=4 >Usage: </strong> </font><p>
<font size=2 >Input:
Cryo EM map: a .map or .mrc file with  3D cryo EM map of a molecule. No additional knowledge (such as sequence or homolog structure ) of the binding site is required.
Resolution: Select the resolution range the input map fails in.
Email: email address for results.</p>
<font size=2 >Output: A list of amino acid locations and types in form of PDB file.</p>
